# Personal website project

### Description

 This project is intended to be used as a way to list my own projects on my own website. This website consists of personal projects that I have been working on my own or projects as a part of a course at the TUT.

Projects that I have done on my own are either done in C++ or Javascript. However, there are also small Python programs that I have made. These range from small stat calculator programs to a website such as this.

The point of this website is to list my projects and to describe them. However, each project page is intended to have some extra information about it such as commit feed from Github. Having a commit feed on a project page is not particularly important, but for me it's important to see what sort of additional functionalities I can implement on this site to enhance it. Also I truly want to learn more things so these additional features give me more experience. 

### Projects

 So far I have made some small projects such as a stat calculator for a video game but I also started to work on a roguelike game with C++ which isn't small project at all. The roguelike game was also used in my Bachelor's thesis and especially the part about dungeon generation with BSP. Other projects descriped on this website include Twitch stream program which purpose was to fetch stream information about current streams and list their information in prefered way on the program.

Finally, on this website there are also a couple of projects that I have been working on as a part of a course completion. One of them is a fully functional website which is sort of a blog that generates blogposts with the help of the registered user's twitter feed. The twist is that the blogposts are generated using Markov chain.

The other school project is a data science related project made with Jupyter Notebook that is running in AWS environment. Project's point was to gather data or use existing data set, clean it, apply some machine learning and try to predict something from it. I had chosen Paris' Airbnb data on which I try to predict prices based on a couple of features.
