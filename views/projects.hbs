          <div class="description">
            <p>From the course I took in Tampere University of Technology related to data science got me interested in trying to make a scraper.</p>
            <p>The idea for now is to scrape a few websites for computer hardware prices and take try to grab those those items that are on sale.</p>
            <p>There is an intention to possibly try to catalog them into database based on their product codes.</p>
